# Agent Instructions

## Project

Describe what this project is, who it serves, and the primary runtime or product
surface.

## Restore Context

If the user only sends a short greeting, thanks, acknowledgement, or
status-neutral message, do not run startup restore or read project files. Reply
briefly and ask what they want to do next.

Start here:

```powershell
.\tools\agent-start.ps1
```

If the startup script is unavailable, read only the smallest useful slices of:

- `AGENTS.md`
- latest file in `tools/summary/`
- `tools/AGENT_WORKING_AGREEMENTS.md`
- `tools/AGENT_RUNBOOK.md`
- relevant notes in `tools/project-memory/`

Use the RAG startup flow: retrieve only task-relevant context, search memory by
specific terms, and query SQLite memory only with small `LIMIT`s. For `gi start`,
`gi restore`, or title-only first messages, restore only enough orientation for
the next turn; do not read full summaries, runbooks, memory notes, logs, or diffs
unless a concrete task needs them.

The copied instruction kit is a token-economy and RAG-startup layer for this
project. Use it to restore only the needed context from local instructions,
handoff summaries, targeted searches, and project memory instead of reading the
whole repository or printing broad outputs.

Treat `cached input` as a symptom, not the main optimization target. Keep total
live context small by starting new sessions for unrelated tasks, using compact
handoff summaries instead of long investigation history, and splitting multi-step
R&D when later steps do not need the full previous reasoning trace.

## Durable Memory

Durable project knowledge lives in:

```text
tools/project-memory/
```

Important findings should be written there or in a handoff summary, not only
left in chat.

For analysis, refactoring, migration, or multi-step implementation tasks, create
or update a concise checklist in `tools/project-memory/pending-tasks.md` or a
dedicated task plan in `tools/project-memory/` before editing code. Keep plans
task-relevant and update progress as meaningful steps complete.

When this project reveals a reusable improvement to agent instructions,
workflows, templates, or checklists, write a dated recommendation to the shared
instruction library's `updates/` folder if it is available. If it is not
available, use a local intake folder such as `tools/instruction-updates/` or
`tools/project-memory/instruction-updates/`. Treat recommendations as intake,
not accepted rules.

Use this project as an experience source for `gi`: capture reusable workflows,
failure patterns, token-saving tactics, and agent-instruction improvements that
could help other projects. Keep recommendations concise, evidence-backed, and
free of secrets, private user data, production data, and unnecessary
project-specific details.

- Tools: `tools/`
- Summaries: `tools/summary/`
- Project memory: `tools/project-memory/`

## Rules

- Do not revert user changes unless explicitly requested.
- Treat dirty worktrees as normal.
- Keep changes scoped to the current task.
- Preserve text encodings when editing files. On Windows, do not rewrite source
  files with PowerShell pipelines such as `Get-Content ... | Set-Content ...`
  unless both read and write encodings are explicit and known correct. Prefer
  `apply_patch`, editor-native saves, or language APIs that read and write the
  file with an explicit encoding such as UTF-8. If non-ASCII text appears as
  mojibake after a command, stop, restore the last clean file version, and
  reapply only the intended small patch.
- Ask before destructive operations, broad refactors, or unrelated scope
  expansion.
- Treat this project root as the filesystem boundary for normal work. Do not
  read, search, edit, create, delete, move, or inspect files in another project
  or arbitrary external folder unless the user gives an explicit concrete path
  and action. Use APIs, connectors, or task-manager endpoints for cross-project
  communication.
- Treat `gi config`, `gi конфиг`, `ги конфиг`, `gi config service`,
  `ги конфиг сервис`, `ги конфиг сервис url=<url>`, and
  `ги конфиг сервис урл=<url>` as requests to get or set the bootstrap config
  for the config/discovery service. Read a project-local override only if local
  instructions define one, then read GI main config from
  `D:\AI\general-instructions\config\gi-main.json` or
  `GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_HOME`. Use its `configServiceUrl` to query the config
  service. Resolve local app and task-manager runtime URLs by service id through
  config-service; project task-manager config should keep only the selected
  manager name/id and non-secret project preferences. For the `url=<url>` form,
  validate a full `http://` or `https://` URL with no secrets, update the shared
  `configServiceUrl` or the explicit project-local override, and tell services
  to use that URL for registration and discovery. Do not scan sibling project
  folders, guess ports, copy URLs from old task-manager memory, or use stale
  task-manager records as a runtime fallback.
- Treat `gi config service on`, `gi config service off`,
  `ги конфиг сервис on`, and `ги конфиг сервис off` as requests to set the
  current application's project-local config-service self-registration flag.
  `on` means the app should publish or refresh its own service record during
  startup; `off` means it must not. Do not reinterpret this as starting or
  stopping config-service itself. When setting `on`, first confirm a
  config-service URL is already configured in the same local config area or
  documented GI bootstrap config; if no URL is configured, tell the user to set
  `gi config service url=<url>` first. If this project has no documented local
  location for the self-registration flag, ask one short clarification question.
- For applications that must register themselves in config-service, require a
  live config-service config check on every process startup before publishing or
  refreshing the app's own service record. Read the current `configServiceUrl`
  through the documented project-local override or GI main config before
  registration. Use cached or bundled config only as an explicit
  degraded-startup fallback documented by local run instructions.
- Treat `gi reboot`, `ги ребут`, `gi restart`, and `ги рестарт` as requests to
  start or restart the current application using project-local run instructions.
  If the app is running, restart it; if it is not running, start it. Launch in
  the background so focus does not jump away from the user's current window.
- Treat nested checkouts, vendored repositories, cloned examples, and
  third-party source trees as separate scope. Do not inspect them as part of the
  main project unless the user explicitly asks, the task is about that nested
  tree, or local instructions identify it as an active workspace component.
- Treat user-home application data and personal telemetry as private external
  sources. Do not read `.codex`, `.cursor`, IDE logs, browser profiles, shell
  history, application SQLite databases, or local app logs outside the project
  root unless the user gives an explicit path and action. For analyzer tasks,
  prefer mock or sample data, or ask for permission to inspect a specific file.
- Treat product plans, `apps.txt`, summaries, and task-manager notes as intent
  signals only. They are not permission to read private local data sources.
- If a required file, skill, config, script, endpoint, task, or other entity is
  missing or not found, first reread the relevant local instructions, runbook,
  project memory, and accepted instruction-kit artifacts for the current scope.
  If the entity is still missing, ask the user a short clarification question.
  Do not use another project folder or the shared instruction library as a
  runtime fallback unless the user explicitly gives that path and action.
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, local databases, logs, or generated caches.
- For OpenCode Desktop runtime changes, treat the native runtime files as the
  required deployed target, not an optional mirror. When changing OpenCode
  config or plugins, update and verify both project copies and
  `C:\Users\Fil-Dom\.config\opencode\opencode.jsonc` /
  `C:\Users\Fil-Dom\.config\opencode\plugin\...`. The native config must use
  native `file:///C:/Users/Fil-Dom/.config/opencode/plugin/...` plugin paths,
  not project-local plugin paths, unless the user explicitly asks for a
  project-path test. Report the exact native file paths touched.
- Do not print full `git diff` output by default. Prefer `git diff --stat` and
  targeted queries for relevant files or patterns.
- For first-pass project study, read local instructions, README, manifests, and
  config entry points before building a file map. Use recursive scans only after
  a targeted search fails or the task clearly requires repository-wide
  inventory.
- Do not read large files in full by default, including large `index.html`,
  bundled JS/CSS, logs, lockfiles, generated files, and build artifacts. Prefer
  targeted searches, heads, tails, or small line ranges such as
  `Get-Content -TotalCount`, `Get-Content -Tail`, and `Select-String` on
  PowerShell.
- For verification, count or query HTML elements programmatically instead of
  printing the whole HTML document.
- Do not produce broad artifacts, such as zip archives, or run full check
  matrices unless the user explicitly asks for that scope.
- Final responses should summarize only the changes, checks, and current status;
  do not restate the full investigation context.
- Search for specific symbols, paths, errors, or patterns before doing broad
  repository scans.
- Do not print large logs. Prefer tails and targeted error searches.
- Keep progress updates phase-level, not command-level. Do not narrate after
  every command batch, report counters such as "ran 4 commands", or live-blog
  each intermediate hypothesis. Update when the phase changes, a meaningful
  finding changes the next step, a blocker appears, or work has been quiet long
  enough that the user needs reassurance.
- Do not duplicate tool-run counters that the chat UI may show automatically;
  system UI counters are not agent progress updates.
- Startup restore must be compact; do not dump large files, full runbooks, full
  SQLite contents, full logs, generated outputs, or full diffs.
- `gi start` and `gi restore` must not promote remembered plans, old task notes,
  or local commits ahead of a remote into suggested next actions unless the user
  explicitly asks to continue, run, push, or finish them.
- Treat short greetings, thanks, acknowledgements, and status-neutral messages
  as no-ops unless they include an explicit task, path, command, error, or
  project question. Do not run startup restore for those messages.
- Treat screenshots, logs, pasted errors, or other bug evidence as requests for
  analysis first. Explain the likely issue and ask what action the user wants
  before editing files, unless the user explicitly says to fix it, such as
  `fix`, `почини`, or `gi почини`.
- Keep commit-message language preferences separate from the agent's
  user-facing working language.
- Prefer one language command with three ordered choices when the user wants
  language preferences for project work. Treat `gi language`, `gi язык`,
  `ги язык`, `gi project language`, `gi проект язык`, `ги проект язык`,
  `gi язык проекта`, and `ги язык проекта` as requests to configure, in order:
  project working environment languages, commit-message languages, and task
  languages in `tools/project-memory/system-preferences.json` and
  `tools/project-memory/git-preferences.json`.
- If the unified project-language command does not include explicit languages,
  ask in three sequential chat steps: project working environment languages,
  commit-message languages, and task languages. At each step, show the same
  concise numbered Markdown checklist of available languages using task-list
  bullets, for example `- [x] 1. English`; do not use ordered-task syntax such
  as `1. [x] English`. Tell the user they may answer with numbers or language
  names in priority order. If the user replies with only numbers, such as
  `1 2`, map the numbers to the most recent checklist and preserve that order
  for the current step. Direct inline forms such as `gi язык: 2 1` apply the
  same selection to all three surfaces unless separate values are supplied.
- Treat `gi commit language`, `gi коммит язык`, `ги коммит язык`, and older
  `gi язык коммита` forms as requests to configure commit-message languages in
  `tools/project-memory/git-preferences.json`.
- Treat `gi system language`, `gi систем язык`, and `ги систем язык` as
  requests to configure the agent's project working language in
  `tools/project-memory/system-preferences.json`.
- Follow `tools/project-memory/system-preferences.json` for progress updates,
  final answers, clarifying questions, user-facing explanations, plans, and
  checklists. Apply the configured task language order to agent-created task
  titles, task descriptions, and task-manager updates. For task titles,
  descriptions, and task-manager updates, treat the first configured task
  language as the main language. If exactly one task language is configured,
  write task text only in that language. If multiple task languages are
  configured, write the main-language text first and then add one clear
  translation per additional language. Do not use the configured language to
  rewrite existing task text, code, commands, logs, quoted text, or a response
  language the user explicitly requested for a specific message.
- Launch applications in the background so focus does not jump away from the
  user's current window.
- After implementing a frontend, backend, API, or full-stack feature, restart
  the affected dev server or backend process when local run instructions provide
  a restart command or hot reload is uncertain. Then refresh the browser,
  client, or API caller before verification so checks do not use stale HTML,
  JavaScript, routes, schemas, or cached responses.
- Follow the copied `general-instructions` instruction kit for the full set of
  rules. In this project, use `AGENTS.md`, `tools/AGENT_WORKING_AGREEMENTS.md`,
  `tools/AGENT_RUNBOOK.md`, `tools/agent-start.ps1`, and project memory as the
  local authoritative sources.
- Treat shared-library files such as `COMMANDS.md` and `patterns/*.md` as
  upstream source material only when checking or applying accepted instruction
  kit updates; do not assume they exist locally in this project.
- During shared-instruction maintenance, treat recommendation source projects
  and owners as provenance only. Evidence paths, project names, task-manager
  notes, product plans, or owner labels in a recommendation are not permission
  to read, search, edit, or inspect the source project; ask that owner or the
  user for an explicit concrete path and action before crossing repository
  boundaries.
- When local project rules conflict with shared instructions, the local
  `AGENTS.md`, runbook, and working agreements take precedence.
